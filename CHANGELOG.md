# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Native apps

- A push bridge for the coming iOS and Android apps: the host's encrypted notices reach them through APNs and FCM, and the bridge never holds a key that opens one. (#705)

### Desktop local host and pairing by code

- The host the desktop app starts joins the relay, so a phone or another computer can pair with this computer by code or link and reach its terminals. (#596)
- Settings > Connections has **Pair a device**: it asks this computer's host for a fresh offer and shows its QR code, link, 8-character code, fingerprint and expiry, then the device that used it — no terminal and no CLI. (#614)

## v0.1.2

### Tabs and spaces

- Tabs belong to a space, as in herdr-app: the tab bar shows the selected space's tabs, each space remembers the tab it showed, and the tab order is the same on every device. A new tab opens right after the one you are on. (#466)
- Rename a space from its menu, the command palette or a double-click; the new name shows on every device. (#416)
- Closing a tab or pane ends its program, and asks first only when the program is still busy; a close that needs no question shows none. (#426, #534)
- A tab follows its machine through a rename. (#495)
- A tab moved while its machine is being renamed stays visible: its layout follows the machine to the new name. (#589)
- A double-click on the tab after the selected one renames it instead of closing it. (#573)

### Sidebar and titlebar

- One sidebar toggle, placed after the macOS window buttons, and a titlebar laid out like herdr-app's. (#445)
- Agents sit at the bottom of the sidebar with a split you can drag, and two spaces with the same name show as separate rows. (#421)
- A machine's header keeps its name ahead of its state, and its buttons have tap areas that don't overlap. (#504)
- The machine header is labelled with the machine's name and state. (#579)
- The desktop app waits for your saved tabs before showing "No terminal open", and a terminal that is still opening says so. (#489)
- Native notifications in the desktop app, using the same triggers and settings as web push. (#412)

### Fonts, Korean text and the terminal

- Terminal text matches Ghostty's metrics, and wide Hangul fits its cells. (#430)
- Korean wraps between words, and a row's icon lines up with its first line. (#487)
- Copied text drops trailing spaces and blank rows, as Ghostty does; Ctrl+Shift+V and Shift+Insert paste; a double- or triple-click selection keeps the keyboard in the terminal. (#528, #532, #530)
- The Ghostty `theme` key accepts any theme in Appearance, by name or id. (#533)
- The import dialogs' line numbers are readable in both themes. (#484)
- On the phone, a long terminal title gets a second line instead of being cut. (#485)

### Connection and offline wording

- Offline, the status bar says the app reconnects when the network is back and offers Try again, and no machine shows as connected while you are offline. (#493)
- Settings explains in words why a host can't be reached; the raw error code is under Details. (#486)
- Coming back from Settings keeps your sessions and reconnects at once. (#456)
- Reload to update now always lands on the new version. (#539)
- There is no Direct address field any more; the relay is shown without an edit field. (#460)
- A machine list that cannot be read says so plainly, with the error under Details, instead of a raw error beside the connection notice. (#552)

### Desktop local host and pairing by code

- If the desktop app's local host has stopped, it is started again before reconnecting. (#525)
- Pairing by code works in the desktop app's release build. (#544)
- The token for this computer's host is only ever sent to this computer. (#463)

### Windows

- The app's state lock no longer trips over a state folder that Windows is still deleting. (#524)
- On Windows arm64, the state lock reads why a file could not be opened from Windows' own status, so a worker no longer dies on a failed open that reports no error. (#578)
- Both Windows installers, x64 and arm64, are now installed and started on a clean machine before each release is published. (#451)
- Windows builds are still not code signed, so SmartScreen warns on first run; see Code signing below.

### Reliability

- A terminal on a link that just dropped no longer throws an error into the page. (#465)
- A stopped host never restarts its terminal core behind your back. (#455)
- Relayed sessions are faster on bulk output and handle split frames correctly. (#517)
- A terminal that floods output no longer slows the app: output is drawn at most once a frame, flow control holds the program back until it is drawn, and hidden panes draw nothing. (#586)
- Ending a terminal reaches the host even when the page closes right after you confirm. (#582)
- A host in a large mesh acknowledges its own changes without re-reading the whole mesh each time. (#577)
- The desktop app's content security policy stays strict while scroll areas hide their native scrollbars. (#520)
- The app starts and keeps working when the browser refuses storage, as private windows and blocked site data do. (#550, #554)
- On phones, the app, its header, its status bar and its sheets keep clear of the notch, the rounded corners and the home indicator on every side. (#561, #565)
- An older browser gets an Update your browser screen instead of a page that does not work. (#563)
- Many test and CI fixes, so problems are caught before a release instead of after.
